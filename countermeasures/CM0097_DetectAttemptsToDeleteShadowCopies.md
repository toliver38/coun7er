## Intended Outcome

Detecting the deletion of shadow copies will alert defenders to an adversary attempting to destroy volume backups.     

## Introduction

Shadow copies are a form of Windows data backup.  Ransomware actors commonly attempt to delete shadow copies before deploying ransomware to inhibit system recovery and make victim data inaccessible until a ransom is paid.  This is typically accomplished using native Windows binaries (Vssadmin.exe, PowerShell.exe, and WMIC.exe).  

## Preparation

- Ensure systems are frequently performing backups.  Backups should be securely stored on a separate device that is inaccessible from the network.  
- Ensure comprehensive endpoint protection and response.  Logs should be aggregated and processed in a centralized location to enable analysis and response efforts.  

## Risks

- No Risks content identified. 

## Guidance

-	Monitor endpoint protection and event logs for process creation `Event ID 4688`
    - Vssadmin.exe
-	Monitor endpoints for the following command line parameters:
    - Vssadmin.exe `Delete Shadows`
    - Vssadmin.exe `resize shadowstorage`
    - Wmic.exe `shadowcopy delete`
    - PowerShell.exe `win32_shadowcopy`
    - `delete shadows`
    - `list shadows`
